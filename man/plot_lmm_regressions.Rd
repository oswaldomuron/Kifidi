\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object specifying the model, including a grouping term
(e.g., \code{y ~ x + (1 | group)}).}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the formula.}

\item{colors}{Named vector of colors for groups. If NULL, colors are generated automatically.}

\item{main}{Plot title.}

\item{xlab}{Label for the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{Label for the y-axis.}

\item{legend}{Logical; whether to display a legend.}

\item{legend_position}{Position of the legend (default "topright").}

\item{draw_group_lines}{Logical; whether to draw regression lines per group.}

\item{draw_overall_line}{Logical; whether to draw overall fixed-effects regression line.}

\item{fixed_lty}{Line type for fixed effects line (default 2).}

\item{fixed_col}{Color for fixed effects line (default "black").}

\item{fixed_lwd}{Line width for fixed effects line (default 1).}

\item{label_equations}{Logical; whether to label lines with regression equations.}

\item{conf.int}{Logical; (Not currently implemented) whether to draw confidence intervals.}

\item{add}{Logical; whether to add to an existing plot.}

\item{lty}{Line types for group lines; can be a single value or named vector.}

\item{lwd}{Line widths for group lines; can be a single value or named vector.}

\item{pch}{Plotting characters for points; can be single or named vector.}

\item{axes}{Logical; whether to draw axes.}

\item{ann}{Logical; whether to annotate plot with labels.}

\item{return_model}{Logical; whether to return the fitted model object.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to plot and points.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL unless \code{return_model = TRUE}, in which case
the fitted \code{lmer} model object is returned.
}
\description{
Fits a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) using the provided formula and data,
then plots the data points and regression lines for each group along with
an optional overall fixed-effects regression line. Also calculates and displays
marginal and conditional R² values.
}
\details{
This function requires the \code{lme4} package. It fits a linear mixed model
based on the formula provided, where a grouping factor must be included as a
random effect term (e.g., (1 | group)). It then plots the raw data points colored
by group, overlays fitted regression lines per group, and optionally an overall
fixed effects regression line. Marginal and conditional R² are calculated
using variance components of the fitted model.
