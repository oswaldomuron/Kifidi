\title{Correlation Matrix and Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) for a Set of Variables}
\usage{
cor_vif_table(data, vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables of interest.}

\item{vars}{A character vector specifying the names of the numeric variables to include.
All specified variables must exist in \code{data}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{correlations}{A numeric matrix of pairwise Pearson correlations among the selected variables.}
\item{VIF}{A data frame with columns \code{Variable} and \code{GVIF}, giving the variance inflation factor for each variable.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the Pearson correlation matrix for a set of numeric variables and calculates
Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) to assess multicollinearity. All variables are included
in the VIF calculation using a dummy response variable in an additive linear model.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The correlation matrix shows pairwise linear associations between variables.
\item VIFs are computed using a linear model with all variables as predictors and a dummy response.
\item The VIF calculation assumes an \strong{additive linear model}: each variable is included as a main effect only,
and no interaction terms or higher-order terms are included.
\item The function automatically removes rows with missing values (NA) in the selected variables.
\item VIFs reflect multicollinearity of each variable with respect to all other variables in the set.

# Create example data frame
set.seed(123)
Z <- data.frame(
  L.AREA  = rnorm(20, mean = 50, sd = 10),
  L.DIST  = rnorm(20, mean = 30, sd = 5),
  L.LDIST = rnorm(20, mean = 15, sd = 3),
  YR.ISOL = rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 2),
  ALT     = rnorm(20, mean = 100, sd = 20),
  GRAZE   = rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 1)
)

# Select variables to analyze
vars <- c("L.AREA", "L.DIST", "L.LDIST", "YR.ISOL", "ALT", "GRAZE")

# Run the correlation and VIF function
result <- cor_vif_table(Z, vars)

# View the correlation matrix
