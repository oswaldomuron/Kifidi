Description: 
    Optimized for handling complex datasets in environmental and ecological 
    research, this package offers functionality that is not fully met by 
    general-purpose packages. It provides two key functions, 'summarize_data()', 
    which summarizes datasets, and 'plot_means()', which creates plots with 
    error bars. The 'plot_means()' function incorporates error bars by default, 
    allowing quick visualization of uncertainties, crucial in ecological 
    studies. It also streamlines workflows for grouped datasets (e.g., 
    by species or treatment), making it particularly user-friendly and reducing 
    the complexity and time required for data summarization and visualization.
